\title{Formatting Instructions For the NeurIPS 2021 \\ Track on Datasets and Benchmarks}

% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two commands
% used to separate the names and addresses of multiple authors: \And and \AND.
%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to LaTeX to determine where to break the
% lines. Using \AND forces a line break at that point. So, if LaTeX puts 3 of 4
% authors names on the first line, and the last on the second line, try using
% \AND instead of \And before the third author name.

\section{Submissions to the NeurIPS 2021 Track on Datasets and Benchmarks}

Please read the instructions below carefully and follow them faithfully.

\subsection{Style}

Papers must be prepared according to the
instructions presented here. Papers may only be up to {\bf nine} pages long,
including figures. Additional pages \emph{containing only acknowledgments and
references} are allowed. Papers that exceed the page limit will not be
reviewed, or in any other way considered for presentation at the conference.

Authors are required to use the NeurIPS \LaTeX{} style files obtainable at the
NeurIPS website as indicated below. Please make sure you use the current files
and not previous versions. Tweaking the style files may be grounds for
rejection.

\subsection{Retrieval of style files}

The style files for the NeurIPS Track on Datasets and Benchmarks and other information are available on the World Wide Web at
\begin{center}
  \url{https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://www.neurips.cc/Conferences/2021/CallForDatasetsBenchmarks__;!!GX6Nv3_Pjr8b-17qtCok029Ok438DqXQ!l-erlUAeEokZ3h7n56lTM5dpI0saUi0X4hdZFLDJEpXTsfAw4H9Y3IBZCwfB$ }
\end{center}
The file \verb+neurips_data_2021.pdf+ contains these instructions and illustrates the
various formatting requirements your submission must satisfy.

The only supported style file for NeurIPS 2021 is \verb+neurips_data_2021.sty+,
written for \LaTeXe{}. There are no supported style sheets for Microsoft Word, RTF, or other formats. The \LaTeX{} style file contains three optional arguments: \verb+final+, which
creates a camera-ready copy, \verb+preprint+, which creates a preprint for
submission to, e.g., arXiv, and \verb+nonatbib+, which will not load the
\verb+natbib+ package for you in case of package clash.

\paragraph{Preprint option}
If you wish to post a preprint of your work online, e.g., on arXiv, using the
NeurIPS style, please use the \verb+preprint+ option. This will create a version of your work with the text ``Preprint. Work in progress.''
in the footer. This version may be distributed as you see fit. Please \textbf{do
  not} use the \verb+final+ option, which should \textbf{only} be used for
papers accepted to the NeurIPS Track on Datasets and Benchmarks.

At submission time, please omit the \verb+final+ and \verb+preprint+
options. This will add line numbers to aid
review. Please do \emph{not} refer to these line numbers in your paper as they
will be removed during generation of camera-ready copies. Note that submissions to the NeurIPS Track on Datasets and Benchmarks are reviewed in a single-blind fashion and therefore not anonymous. This is because datasets can typically not be shared in a non-anonymous way. If you feel strongly that your work should be submitted anonymously, please use the \verb+anonymous+ option. This will create a version of your work with all author names hidden.

The file \verb+neurips_data_021.tex+ may be used as a ``shell'' for writing your
paper. All you have to do is replace the author, title, abstract, and text of
the paper with your own.

The formatting instructions contained in these style files are summarized in
Sections \ref{gen_inst}, \ref{headings}, and \ref{others} below.

\section{General formatting instructions}
\label{gen_inst}

The text must be confined within a rectangle 5.5~inches (33~picas) wide and
9~inches (54~picas) long. The left margin is 1.5~inch (9~picas).  Use 10~point
type with a vertical spacing (leading) of 11~points.  Times New Roman is the
preferred typeface throughout, and will be selected for you by default.
Paragraphs are separated by \nicefrac{1}{2}~line space (5.5 points), with no
indentation.

The paper title should be 17~point, initial caps/lower case, bold, centered
between two horizontal rules. The top rule should be 4~points thick and the
bottom rule should be 1~point thick. Allow \nicefrac{1}{4}~inch space above and
below the title to rules. All pages should start at 1~inch (6~picas) from the
top of the page.

Authors' names are set in boldface, and each name is
centered above the corresponding address. The lead author's name is to be listed
first (left-most), and the co-authors' names (if different address) are set to
follow. If there is only one co-author, list both author and co-author side by
side.

Please pay special attention to the instructions in Section \ref{others}
regarding figures, tables, acknowledgments, and references.

\section{Headings: first level}
\label{headings}

All headings should be lower case (except for first word and proper nouns),
flush left, and bold.

First-level headings should be in 12-point type.

\subsection{Headings: second level}

Second-level headings should be in 10-point type.

\subsubsection{Headings: third level}

Third-level headings should be in 10-point type.

\paragraph{Paragraphs}

There is also a \verb+\paragraph+ command available, which sets the heading in
bold, flush left, and inline with the text, with the heading followed by 1\,em
of space.

\section{Citations, figures, tables, references}
\label{others}

These instructions apply to everyone.

\subsection{Citations within the text}

The \verb+natbib+ package will be loaded for you by default.  Citations may be
author/year or numeric, as long as you maintain internal consistency.  As to the
format of the references themselves, any style is acceptable as long as it is
used consistently.

The documentation for \verb+natbib+ may be found at
\begin{center}
  \url{https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/natbib/natnotes.pdf__;!!GX6Nv3_Pjr8b-17qtCok029Ok438DqXQ!l-erlUAeEokZ3h7n56lTM5dpI0saUi0X4hdZFLDJEpXTsfAw4H9Y3NsZPvhF$ }
\end{center}
Of note is the command \verb+\citet+, which produces citations appropriate for
use in inline text.  For example,
\begin{verbatim}
   \citet{hasselmo} investigated\dots
\end{verbatim}
produces
\begin{quote}
  Hasselmo, et al.\ (1995) investigated\dots
\end{quote}

If you wish to load the \verb+natbib+ package with options, you may add the
following before loading the \verb+neurips_2021+ package:
\begin{verbatim}
   \PassOptionsToPackage{options}{natbib}
\end{verbatim}

If \verb+natbib+ clashes with another package you load, you can add the optional
argument \verb+nonatbib+ when loading the style file:
\begin{verbatim}
   \usepackage[nonatbib]{neurips_2021}
\end{verbatim}

As submission is double blind, refer to your own published work in the third
person. That is, use ``In the previous work of Jones et al.\ [4],'' not ``In our
previous work [4].'' If you cite your other papers that are not widely available
(e.g., a journal paper under review), use anonymous author names in the
citation, e.g., an author of the form ``A.\ Anonymous.''

\subsection{Footnotes}

Footnotes should be used sparingly.  If you do require a footnote, indicate
footnotes with a number\footnote{Sample of the first footnote.} in the
text. Place the footnotes at the bottom of the page on which they appear.
Precede the footnote with a horizontal rule of 2~inches (12~picas).

Note that footnotes are properly typeset \emph{after} punctuation
marks.\footnote{As in this example.}

\subsection{Figures}

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \fbox{\rule[-.5cm]{0cm}{4cm} \rule[-.5cm]{4cm}{0cm}}
  \caption{Sample figure caption.}
\end{figure}

All artwork must be neat, clean, and legible. Lines should be dark enough for
purposes of reproduction. The figure number and caption always appear after the
figure. Place one line space before the figure caption and one line space after
the figure. The figure caption should be lower case (except for first word and
proper nouns); figures are numbered consecutively.

You may use color figures.  However, it is best for the figure captions and the
paper body to be legible if the paper is printed in either black/white or in
color.

\subsection{Tables}

All tables must be centered, neat, clean and legible.  The table number and
title always appear before the table.  See Table~\ref{sample-table}.

Place one line space before the table title, one line space after the
table title, and one line space after the table. The table title must
be lower case (except for first word and proper nouns); tables are
numbered consecutively.

Note that publication-quality tables \emph{do not contain vertical rules.} We
strongly suggest the use of the \verb+booktabs+ package, which allows for
typesetting high-quality, professional tables:
\begin{center}
  \url{https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.ctan.org/pkg/booktabs__;!!GX6Nv3_Pjr8b-17qtCok029Ok438DqXQ!l-erlUAeEokZ3h7n56lTM5dpI0saUi0X4hdZFLDJEpXTsfAw4H9Y3NdoMrBm$ }
\end{center}
This package was used to typeset Table~\ref{sample-table}.

\begin{table}
  \caption{Sample table title}
  \label{sample-table}
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{lll}
    \toprule
    \multicolumn{2}{c}{Part}                   \\
    \cmidrule(r){1-2}
    Name     & Description     & Size ($\mu$m) \\
    \midrule
    Dendrite & Input terminal  & $\sim$100     \\
    Axon     & Output terminal & $\sim$10      \\
    Soma     & Cell body       & up to $10^6$  \\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\section{Final instructions}

Do not change any aspects of the formatting parameters in the style files.  In
particular, do not modify the width or length of the rectangle the text should
fit into, and do not change font sizes (except perhaps in the
\textbf{References} section; see below). Please note that pages should be
numbered.

\section{Preparing PDF files}

Please prepare submission files with paper size ``US Letter,'' and not, for
example, ``A4.''

Fonts were the main cause of problems in the past years. Your PDF file must only
contain Type 1 or Embedded TrueType fonts. Here are a few instructions to
achieve this.

\begin{itemize}

\item You should directly generate PDF files using \verb+pdflatex+.

\item You can check which fonts a PDF files uses.  In Acrobat Reader, select the
  menu Files$>$Document Properties$>$Fonts and select Show All Fonts. You can
  also use the program \verb+pdffonts+ which comes with \verb+xpdf+ and is
  available out-of-the-box on most Linux machines.

\item The IEEE has recommendations for generating PDF files whose fonts are also
  acceptable for NeurIPS. Please see
  \url{https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://www.emfield.org/icuwb2010/downloads/IEEE-PDF-SpecV32.pdf__;!!GX6Nv3_Pjr8b-17qtCok029Ok438DqXQ!l-erlUAeEokZ3h7n56lTM5dpI0saUi0X4hdZFLDJEpXTsfAw4H9Y3L-AM7CE$ }

\item \verb+xfig+ "patterned" shapes are implemented with bitmap fonts.  Use
  "solid" shapes instead.

\item The \verb+\bbold+ package almost always uses bitmap fonts.  You should use
  the equivalent AMS Fonts:
\begin{verbatim}
   \usepackage{amsfonts}
\end{verbatim}
followed by, e.g., \verb+\mathbb{R}+, \verb+\mathbb{N}+, or \verb+\mathbb{C}+
for $\mathbb{R}$, $\mathbb{N}$ or $\mathbb{C}$.  You can also use the following
workaround for reals, natural and complex:
\begin{verbatim}
   \newcommand{\RR}{I\!\!R} %real numbers
   \newcommand{\Nat}{I\!\!N} %natural numbers
   \newcommand{\CC}{I\!\!\!\!C} %complex numbers
\end{verbatim}
Note that \verb+amsfonts+ is automatically loaded by the \verb+amssymb+ package.

\end{itemize}

If your file contains type 3 fonts or non embedded TrueType fonts, we will ask
you to fix it.

\subsection{Margins in \LaTeX{}}

Most of the margin problems come from figures positioned by hand using
\verb+\special+ or other commands. We suggest using the command
\verb+\includegraphics+ from the \verb+graphicx+ package. Always specify the
figure width as a multiple of the line width as in the example below:
\begin{verbatim}
   \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx} ...
   \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{myfile.pdf}
\end{verbatim}
See Section 4.4 in the graphics bundle documentation
(\url{https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/required/graphics/grfguide.pdf__;!!GX6Nv3_Pjr8b-17qtCok029Ok438DqXQ!l-erlUAeEokZ3h7n56lTM5dpI0saUi0X4hdZFLDJEpXTsfAw4H9Y3L8-b0iF$ })

A number of width problems arise when \LaTeX{} cannot properly hyphenate a
line. Please give LaTeX hyphenation hints using the \verb+\-+ command when
necessary.

\subsection{Suppressing line numbers in supplementary materials}
If you need to suppress line numbers in the supplementary materials because 
they interfere with the text, for instance because you are including a 
data sheet in 2-column format, you can do so by
placing the following command before it:
\begin{verbatim}
    \let\linenumbers\nolinenumbers\nolinenumbers
\end{verbatim}

\begin{ack}
Use unnumbered first level headings for the acknowledgments. All acknowledgments
go at the end of the paper before the list of references. Moreover, you are required to declare
funding (financial activities supporting the submitted work) and competing interests (related financial activities outside the submitted work).
More information about this disclosure can be found at: \url{https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2021/PaperInformation/FundingDisclosure__;!!GX6Nv3_Pjr8b-17qtCok029Ok438DqXQ!l-erlUAeEokZ3h7n56lTM5dpI0saUi0X4hdZFLDJEpXTsfAw4H9Y3KyITTo3$ }.

Do {\bf not} include this section in the anonymized submission, only in the final paper. You can use the \texttt{ack} environment provided in the style file to autmoatically hide this section in the anonymized submission.
\end{ack}

\section*{References}

References follow the acknowledgments. Use unnumbered first-level heading for
the references. Any choice of citation style is acceptable as long as you are
consistent. It is permissible to reduce the font size to \verb+small+ (9 point)
when listing the references.
Note that the Reference section does not count towards the page limit.

\appendix

\section{Appendix}

Include extra information in the appendix. This section will often be part of the supplemental material. Please see the call on the NeurIPS website for links to additional guides on dataset publication.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Submission introducing new datasets must include the following in the supplementary materials:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Dataset documentation and intended uses. Recommended documentation frameworks include datasheets for datasets, dataset nutrition labels, data statements for NLP, and accountability frameworks.
  \item URL to website/platform where the dataset/benchmark can be viewed and downloaded by the reviewers.
  \item Author statement that they bear all responsibility in case of violation of rights, etc., and confirmation of the data license.
  \item Hosting, licensing, and maintenance plan. The choice of hosting platform is yours, as long as you ensure access to the data (possibly through a curated interface) and will provide the necessary maintenance.
\end{enumerate}

\item To ensure accessibility, the supplementary materials for datasets must include the following:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Links to access the dataset and its metadata. This can be hidden upon submission if the dataset is not yet publicly available but must be added in the camera-ready version. In select cases, e.g when the data can only be released at a later date, this can be added afterward. Simulation environments should link to (open source) code repositories.
  \item The dataset itself should ideally use an open and widely used data format. Provide a detailed explanation on how the dataset can be read. For simulation environments, use existing frameworks or explain how they can be used.
  \item Long-term preservation: It must be clear that the dataset will be available for a long time, either by uploading to a data repository or by explaining how the authors themselves will ensure this.
  \item Explicit license: Authors must choose a license, ideally a CC license for datasets, or an open source license for code (e.g. RL environments).
  \item Add structured metadata to a dataset's meta-data page using Web standards (like schema.org and DCAT): This allows it to be discovered and organized by anyone. If you use an existing data repository, this is often done automatically.
  \item Highly recommended: a persistent dereferenceable identifier (e.g. a DOI minted by a data repository or a prefix on identifiers.org) for datasets, or a code repository (e.g. GitHub, GitLab,...) for code. If this is not possible or useful, please explain why.
\end{enumerate}

\item For benchmarks, the supplementary materials must ensure that all results are easily reproducible. Where possible, use a reproducibility framework such as the ML reproducibility checklist, or otherwise guarantee that all results can be easily reproduced, i.e. all necessary datasets, code, and evaluation procedures must be accessible and documented.

\item For papers introducing best practices in creating or curating datasets and benchmarks, the above supplementary materials are not required.
\end{enumerate}
