This directory contains the data in its raw, original format as obtained in
multiple FOIA requests to the CPD. There is one subfolder per request,
identified by the FOIA request number. Each subfolder contains the original
Excel data files along with the request and answer letters when available.

More information about each request, including what kind of information was
requested as well as the date of the request is collected in the file
[`datasets.csv`](datasets.csv).
