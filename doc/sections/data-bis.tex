\paragraph{Roster consolidation.}

A byproduct of matching officers across datasets is that for each officer, we
now have as many “profiles” as the number of datasets in which they appear,
where by \emph{profile} we mean a collection of attributes. Note that each
profile can contain a different subset of attributes (since not all attributes
are present in each dataset) and that a given attribute might take a different
value in different profiles of the same officer (since the iterative matching
procedure is not restricted to performing strict matching).

We are thus faced with the task of “consolidating” the different profiles of
a given officer into a single profile. Of course, if an attribute is present in
a single profile, and absent from the others, this is the value we keep in the
consolidated profile. But if an attribute appears with different values across
different profiles, we choose the value coming from the profile corresponding
to the \emph{most recent data release}.
