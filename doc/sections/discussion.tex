\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Intended Use}
Benchmark algorithms for:
\begin{itemize}
	\item community detection (where for example unit assignment can be used to
		have a ground truth
	\item network inference from contagion data (complaint network can be used
		as ground truth, shootings as the contagion)
	\item time series prediction over networks
\end{itemize}

Relatedly, useful to assess and design contagion models


\textbf{TODO:} the following was copy-pasted from Daria's email.

In my view, in discussing intended uses for the data set, we should probably focus attention at the outset on the benchmarking capacities for our data:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Algorithms to detect network spatial and temporal clustering
	\item Algorithms to fit models of contagion on the network (in addition to shooting generally, researchers can examine other behaviors independently documented, like foot-chase shootings, use of force during arrest, abusive charging behavior, but also laudatory behavior like complying with reporting requirements, etc.)
\end{itemize}

Other uses for this dataset can include:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Correlating police behavior to police traits and complainant traits (like race, gender, location of assignment/residence, years on force, etc.)
	\item Correlating complaint filing frequency to police traits and complainant traits (see above)
	\item Creating network graphs for subunits of interest (particular police patrol districts, for example).
	\item Tracking complaint trends relative to external events like new disciplinary practices, new training techniques, new oversight (Department of Justice, police union monitoring, new civilian oversight, publication of shootings in major papers) and other events like high-profile scandals, introduction of new technologies like Tasers, etc.
	\item Subject to caveats, investigating how to control for the dangerousness of police work when investigating the frequency of particular police behaviors (use of excessive force, wrongful arrest, abusive speech, etc.)
\end{itemize}
