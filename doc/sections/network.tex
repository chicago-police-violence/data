\subsection{Building an officers' network}

Among several tasks, we can use the CPD dataset to perform network analysis. \textcolor{red}{Should cite policing papers who do network analysis?}. For example, we can use the \texttt{complaints\_officers.csv} data to construct an undirected graph $\mathcal{G} = \{\mathcal{V}, \mathcal{E}\}$, in which $\mathcal{V}$ is the set of nodes --- officers appearing in at least one complaint, and $\mathcal{E}$ the set of edges --- where an edge is present whenever two officers appeared on the same complaint. Moreover, we can link the complaints to the \texttt{tactical\_response\_reports.csv} file, to consider also the subgraph of officers who were also listed in a TRR. We report summary for the corresponding graphs in \Cref{tab:stats_graphs}. Here, we consider any complaint available to form an edge, but we only consider TRRs filed after January 1st 2004, and before December 1st 2015.
