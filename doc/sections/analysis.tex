\section{Examples and data analysis} \label{sec:analysis}

In this section, we provide examples and use-cases on the dataset. Code to reproduce our examples is available online, in the \texttt{examples} folder.

\subsection{Summary statistics}

First, we start by providing some summary statistics. 

\subsubsection{The roster file}
The file \texttt{roster.csv} contains information about $N=35{,}430$ CPD officers. For each officer --- identified by a Unique Identifier (``uid''), \texttt{roster.csv} provides, among other covariates, the officer's name, gender, race, birthyear, appointment and resignation dates. It is straightforward  to use the data to generate summary statistics, e.g., using appointment and resignation dates to understand the number of appointments, retirements as well as active officers over the years of  (\Cref{fig:history}). We report in \Cref{tab:stats} some 
\begin{figure}[h]

The left subplot shows the number of officers' appointments, the central subplot the number of officers' resignations, while the right subplot shows the number of active officers in the database (vertical axis) as a function of time (horizontal axis).} \label{fig:history}

\subsection{Tactical response reports}

The file \texttt{P0-46360\_main.csv} contains information about tactical response reports, filed as a consequence of  events involving use of force of CPD officers. This dataset contains $9{,}246$ distinct events, as identified by the index ``\texttt{event\_no}'', between January 17th 2004 and April 12th 2016. For each event, the time and location is recorded. Details about the officers involved, as well as the civilian subject are available too.
