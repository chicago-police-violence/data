\paragraph{Who created the dataset, and on behalf of which entity?}

\paragraph{Who funded the creation of the dataset?}

\paragraph{Any other comments?}

\subsection{Composition}

\paragraph{What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent?}

\paragraph{How many instances are there in total (of each type)?}

\paragraph{Does the dataset contain all possible instances or is it a sample of instances from a larger set?}

\paragraph{What data does each instance consist of?}

\paragraph{Is there a label or target associated with each instance?}

\paragraph{Is any information missing from individual instances?}

\paragraph{Are relationships between individual instances made explicit?}

\paragraph{Are there recommended data splits?}

\paragraph{Are there any errors, sources of noise, or redundancies in the dataset?}

\paragraph{Is the dataset self-contained, or does it rely on external resources?}

\paragraph{Does the dataset contain data that might be considered confidential?}

\paragraph{Does the dataset contain data that, if viewed directly, might be offensive, insulting, or threatening?}

\paragraph{Does the dataset relate to people?} 

\paragraph{Does the dataset identify any subpopulations?}

\paragraph{Is it possible to identify individuals?}

\paragraph{Does the dataset contain data that might be considered sensitive in any way?}

\subsection{Collection Process}

\paragraph{How was the data associated with each instance acquired?}

\paragraph{What mechanisms or procedures were used to collect the data?}

\paragraph{If the data are a sample from a larger set, what was the sampling strategy?}

\paragraph{Who was involved in the data collection process and how were they compensated?}

\paragraph{Over what timeframe was the data collected?}

\paragraph{Were any ethical review processes conducted?}

\paragraph{Does the dataset relate to people?}

\paragraph{Did you collect the data from the individuals directly, or obtain it via third parties?}

\paragraph{Were the individuals notified about the data collection?}

\paragraph{Did the individuals in question consent to the collection and use of their data?}

\paragraph{If consent was obtained, were the consenting individuals provided with a mechanism to revoke their consent in the future or for certain uses?}

\paragraph{Has analysis of the potential impact of the dataset and its use on data subjects been conducted?}

\subsection{Preprocessing and cleaning}

\paragraph{Was any preprocessing of the data done?}

\paragraph{Was the ``raw'' data saved in addition to the cleaned data?}

\paragraph{Is the software used to clean the data available?}

\subsection{Uses}

\paragraph{Has the dataset been used for any tasks already?}

\paragraph{Is there a repository that links to any or all papers that use the dataset?}

\paragraph{What (other) tasks could the dataset be used for?}

\paragraph{Is there anything about the composition of the dataset or the way it was collected and cleaned that might impact future uses?}

\paragraph{Are there tasks for which the dataset should not be used?}

\subsection{Distribution}

\paragraph{Will the dataset be distributed to third parties outside of the entity on behalf of which the dataset was created?}

Yes, the data is publicly available.

\paragraph{How will the dataset be distributed?}

It is available on GitHub at \url{https://github.com/chicago-police-violence/data}.

\paragraph{When will the dataset be distributed?}

It is currently publicly accessible.

\paragraph{Will the dataset be distributed under a copyright, other IP license, or terms of use?}

Yes; the source code is released under the MIT license, and the data output by the cleaning code is released under the Creative Commons 4.0 BY-NC-SA license.

\paragraph{Have any third parties imposed IP-based or other restrictions on the data associated with the instances?}

No.

\paragraph{Do any export controls or other regulatory restrictions apply to the data?}

No.

\subsection{Maintenance}

\paragraph{Who is supporting/hosting/maintaining the dataset?}

The repository will be hosted on GitHub. As of August 2021, the repository
owners are Thibaut Horel, Trevor Campbell, and Lorenzo Masoero, but ownership
may change over time.

\paragraph{How can the data owner/curator be contacted?}

Issue threads on GitHub are the primary channel of contact for the repository maintainers.

\paragraph{Is there an erratum?}

Not as of yet. For each major release version, notes will be included and
hosted in the repository that will detail cleaning/linking errors that have been fixed.

\paragraph{Will the dataset be updated?}

The original raw source data from FOIA requests will not be modified. More raw
data files may be added over time corresponding to new FOIA requests. The data
cleaning and linking code will be edited over time to fix errors; release
versions will be clearly marked on GitHub.

\paragraph{If the dataset relates to people, are there applicable limits on the retention of data associated with the instances?}

No; this data was released per FOIA requests and is in the public domain.

\paragraph{Will older versions of the dataset continue to be supported/hosted/maintained?}

Yes; a full version-controlled history of the project will exist on GitHub.

\paragraph{If others want to extend/augment/build on/contribute to the dataset, is there a mechanism for them to do so?}

Yes; the repository for the dataset is hosted on GitHub, where pull requests are a usual channel for external contribution.
