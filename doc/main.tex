The lack of accessibility to data on policing has severely limited researchers'
ability to conduct thorough quantitative analyses on police activity and
behavior, particularly with regard to predicting and explaining police
violence. In the present work, we provide a new dataset that contains
information on the personnel, activities, use of force, and complaints in the
Chicago Police Department (CPD). The raw data, obtained from the CPD via a
series of requests under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), consists of 35
unlinked, inconsistent, and undocumented spreadsheets. Our paper provides a
cleaned, linked, and documented version of this data that can be reproducibly
generated via open source code. We provide a detailed description of the
dataset contents, the procedures for cleaning the data, and summary statistics.
The data have a rich variety of uses, such as prediction (e.g., predicting
misconduct from officer traits, experience, and assigned units), network
analysis (e.g., detecting communities within the social network of officers
co-listed on complaints), spatiotemporal data analysis (e.g., investigating
patterns of officer shooting events), causal inference (e.g., tracking the
effects of new disciplinary practices, new training techniques, and new
oversight on complaints and use of force), and much more. Access to this
dataset will enable the machine learning community to meaningfully engage with
the problem of police violence.
