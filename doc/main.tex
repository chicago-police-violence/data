\title{The CPD Data Set: Personnel, Use of Force, and Complaints in the Chicago Police Department}

\begin{document}


\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
For decades, researchers who study policing have been hampered by a lack of
access to reliable data, and in particular data on police misconduct. Law
enforcement agencies do not release such data to the public or release only
limited information. In the present work, we provide an integrated dataset that
contains information on individual police officers together with their career
history, their use of force history, and complaints filed against them. The
underlying data, which was obtained from the Chicago Police Department under
the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), comprised multiple unlinked and
inconsistent spreadsheets. Our paper cuts through the chaos to provide
a cleaned, carefully linked, and well-documented version of this data that
researchers can easily reproduce via open-source code. We describe the dataset
contents in detail, and set forth a detailed set of procedures for cleaning and
linking the data on individual officers across multiple sources. We also review
the rich variety of uses for the data, such as prediction (e.g., predicting
misconduct from officer traits, experience, and assigned units), spatiotemporal
network analysis (e.g., investigating patterns of officer shooting events on
professional networks), causal inference (e.g., tracking the effects of new
disciplinary and training techniques on police use of force), and much more.
Access to this usable dataset will enable the machine learning community to
meaningfully engage with the problem of police violence.

\textbf{Instructions:} run \url{make} in the repository root directory. See \url{README.md} for detailed instructions.\\
\textbf{Data Set:} may be found in the \url{final/} directory after running \url{make}.
\tbo{should create a \texttt{.tar.gz} of the final dataset and also attach it
to the release in Github to be able to link to the data directly. If we claim
to to be releasing a new dataset, there should be a direct link to the data.}
